        <p>Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has marked <strong><%= @schools.count %> elementary schools</strong> for possible closure based on utilization and performance. Closing a school is a very disruptive decision, affecting student outcomes, parental confidence, and neighborhood stability. In addition to showing the data being used by CPS, this website aims to help school leaders, parents, and communities learn more about the schools being considered, and what options will be available in case of closures.</p>
