        <h1>43,360 students await school closings decision</h1>
        <p>In limiting the examination of potential school closings to a standard utilization formula and a high-level performance metric, CPS risks making decisions that could damage the long-term educational outcomes of students from specific neighborhoods, the stability of neighborhoods, and the trust/engagement of parents across the District. Weâ€™ve assembled this data hoping to provide a clearer pictures of these schools, and offer some insight into choices parents will have to make if/when their neighborhood school is closed.</p>
